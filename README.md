# CNN

Design a simple CNN model along with your own convolutional network for a more realistic dataset â€“ MiniPlaces, again using PyTorch. \

MiniPlaces is a scene recognition dataset developed by MIT. This dataset has 120K images from 100 scene categories. The categories are mutually exclusive. The dataset is split into 100K images for training, 10K images for
validation, and 10K for testing.\
